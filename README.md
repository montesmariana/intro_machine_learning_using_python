# Script: Translation Vendor Database

## The repository
This repository has been created by Elmo Geeraerts for the final assignment of an introductory class on python.

The repository contains:
- The `README.md` file which describes the repository and illustrates how to use the code as a module and by running the script;
- The `tutorial.md` and `tutorial.ipynb` files which show how to actually use the code and the different functionalities;
- Two `xlsx` files which were generated while creating the `tutorial.ipynb` file. Be aware that if you run the code in the tutorial notebook, some data will be duplicated in the excel if you do not change anything. To avoid this you can delete the two excel files from the directory or you can change the data in the tutorial code to fit your needs. Or you could import the os package and run os.remove('path/to/the/file.xlsx);
- The `vendor_data.py` file, i.e. the actual python script that can be run or imported as a module.

## Installation and usage

### As a module
Clone this repository with the following git command in the console (or download the ZIP file via GitHub):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ElmoGeeraerts/intro_machine_learning_using_python.git
```

You can import the script as a module by adding the repository to your path in a Python script or interactive notebook and then calling `import`.

```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/path/to/intro_machine_learning_using_python')
import vendor_data as vd
```

Check out `tutorial.md` to see an example of the different functionalities of the script!

### Running the script
You can also run the script directly with the following code in a console:

```sh
python vendor_data.py <-a/--add>
```
to add a vendor. You will be prompted with some questions to input the data. Or you can run:

```sh
python vendor_data.py <-m/modify>
```
to modify a vendor. Again you will be prompted with some questions to input the data.

Or in Jupyter notebook with:

```python
%run vendor_data.py <-a/--add>
```
OR
```python
%run vendor_data.py <-m/--modify>
```

For more information you can run the command below, or check in the notebook tuturial.ipynb in this repository under "Running `vendor_data.py`".

```sh
python vendor_data.py --help
```

## What this script CAN do

This script is supposed to help translation project managers with keeping a clear overview of the vendors working on the a particular project.
The script allows the project manager to:
1. Easily create an excel file with the project name and the source language as filename;
2. Write the following data to the excel file: the target language and the translator's name, e-mail, word rate, preferred CAT tool and the status of the translator;
3. Modify the following data for the vendors already in the excel file: e-mail, word rate, preferred CAT tool and status.
The main advantage of this script is that it limits the posibilities of CAT tools and statuses and that it validates e-mail and word rate (betw. 0.01 and 0.15). This prevents the excel file from becoming messy when different people are working on the project.

## What this script CANNOT do
There are limits to this script that - with more practice, knowledge and time - might be resolved in the form of new functionalities.
With this script you CANNOT:
- Look up specific vendors;
- Join multiple excel files in the excel file created by this code.
- not create multiple entries for the same vendor if the excel file already exists and the ToExcel() method is called multiple times for the same vendor.
- delete vendors from the file;
- modify multiple keys in a dictionary if the script is imported as a module.
